# Life-Expectancy
The research on life expectancy in countries takes the spotlight in the notebook's machine learning model. Substantial data analysis and predictive algorithms are used to uncover the reasons causing differences in longevity among countries. With the aid of strong statistical tools, valuable insights into the complex link between healthcare, socioeconomic factors, and life expectancy are sought

About the features:-

Country-Country name(target variable) Year-year of survey Status-Status of the country's development(target variable) Population-Population of country Hepatitis B-Percentage of people finally one year old who were immunized against hepatitis B Measles-The number of reported measles cases per 1000 people Polio-Percentage of 1-year-olds immunized against polio Diphtheria-Percentage of people finally one year old who were immunized against diphtheria HIV/AIDS-The number of deaths caused by AIDS of the last 4-year-olds who were born alive per 1000 people infant deaths-The number of infant deaths per 1000 people under-five deaths-The number of deaths of people under 5 years old per 1000 people Total expenditure-The ratio of government medical-health expenses to total government expenses in percentage GDP-Gross domestic product BMI-The average body mass index of the entire population of the country thinness 1-19 years-Prevalence of thinness among people 19 years old in percentage Alcohol-Liters of alcohol consumption among people over 15 years old Schooling-The number of years that people study Life expectancy-Country life expectancy(target variable)

Aim:-

The dataset aims to provide insights into the relationship between the non target features and the target features. Researchers and data analysts can use this dataset to explore the impact of Hepatitus B, Measles, Polio, Diphtheria and HIV/AIDS on the Life expectancy and GDP, Schooling and Population on the Status of the country.
